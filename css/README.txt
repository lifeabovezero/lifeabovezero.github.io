A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/Michiel/pen/mbHCx.

 After I saw Rafal Chmiel's [pen with Medium style dividers](http://codepen.io/rafalchmiel/details/Cjacq/) on the CodePen frontpage I thought to myself <q>This should be possible with simpler markup that is accessible.</q>

Updated in June 2015: Markdown no longer renders if placed inside HTML on CodePen.
