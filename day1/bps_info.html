    <center><h1>DAY 1</h1></center>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Hello again!</h2>
    <p>The activity you are about to do focuses on cultivating a sense of gratitude right
        now, and during the next 1 week. ‘‘Cultivate a sense of gratitude’’ means that
        you make an effort to think about the many things in your life, both large and
        small, that you have to be grateful about. These might include particular
        supportive relationships, sacrifices or contributions that others have made for
        you, facts about your life such as your advantages and opportunities, or even
        gratitude for life itself, and the world that we live in. In all of these cases you
        are identifying previously unappreciated aspects of your life, for which you can
        be thankful. You may not have thought about yourself in this way before, but
        research suggests that doing so can have a strong positive effect on your mood
        and life satisfaction. Please write about the many things in your life, both large
        and small, that you are grateful for in the space provided below. Also, we’d like
        to ask you to continue thinking in this way over the week, following up on the
        initial writing that you’re about to do.</p>

    <p>Please write about the many things in your life, both large and small, that you
        are grateful about. Further, please outline the reasons why you are grateful for
        these things in as much detail as possible.</p>
