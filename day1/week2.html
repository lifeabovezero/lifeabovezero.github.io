    <center><h1>Week 2</h1></center>
    <hr/>
    <h2>Hello again!</h2>
    <p>Think about your best possible self means that you imagine yourself in the future, after everything
        has gone as well as it possibly could. You have worked hard and succeeded at accomplishing all of
        your life goals. Think of this as the realization of your life dreams, and of your own best potentials. In
        all of these cases you are identifying the best possible way that things might turn out in your life, in
        order to help guide your decisions now. You may not have thought about yourself in this way before,
        but research suggests that doing so can have a strong positive effect on your mood and life
        satisfaction. Please write about what you imagined in the space provided below. Also, we’d like to
        ask you to continue thinking in this way over the week, following up on the initial writing that you’re
        about to do.</p>
    <hr/>
    <br><br>
    <p>Now, please write continuously about what you imagined. Use the instructions below to help guide you through this process:</p>
    <p>1) Be as creative and imaginative as you desire.</p>
    <p>2) Use whatever writing style you please, but remember to imagine your ideal life in the FUTURE (say in the next 10 years).</p>
    <p>3) Do not worry about perfect grammar and spelling.</p>
    <p>4) Use as much detail as you want.</p>
